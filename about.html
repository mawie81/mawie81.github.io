## About

Hi, I'm a user interface developer and designer, with extensive knowledge in AngularJS.

I live in Leipzig, Germany and work as a Frontend Engineer at [Spreadshirt](http://www.spreadshirt.net).
In my day-to-day work I mostly use [AngularJS](https://angular.io) to build rich single page web apps. But IÂ´m also interested in other frameworks and tools like [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) or [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).

Before working on frontend stuff I used to code a lot of C# for both the web and the desktop, but I have discovered that my passion and focus is with highly interactive user interfaces. I want to make great ideas become reality, with obsessive attention to detail.

When not working on code I like to travel the world. Its a joy to explore the many great places out there!
